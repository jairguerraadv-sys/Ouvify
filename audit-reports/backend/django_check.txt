ERRORS:
?: (drf_spectacular.E001) Schema generation threw exception "Field name `nome` is not valid for model `User` in `apps.auditlog.serializers.AuditLogUserSerializer`."

WARNINGS:
?: (drf_spectacular.W001) /workspaces/Ouvify/apps/backend/apps/auditlog/views.py: Warning [AuditLogViewSet]: Failed to obtain model through view's queryset due to raised exception. Prevent this either by setting "queryset = Model.objects.none()" on the view, checking for "getattr(self, "swagger_fake_view", False)" in get_queryset() or by simply using @extend_schema. (Exception: Field 'id' expected a number but got <django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser object at 0x75f49d20b860>.)
?: (drf_spectacular.W001) /workspaces/Ouvify/apps/backend/apps/notifications/views.py: Warning [NotificationViewSet]: could not derive type of path parameter "id" because it is untyped and obtaining queryset from the viewset failed. Consider adding a type to the path (e.g. <int:id>) or annotating the parameter type with @extend_schema. Defaulting to "string".

?: (security.W003) You don't appear to be using Django's built-in cross-site request forgery protection via the middleware ('django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' is not in your MIDDLEWARE). Enabling the middleware is the safest approach to ensure you don't leave any holes.
?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
?: (security.W008) Your SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting is not set to True. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL connections, you may want to either set this setting True or configure a load balancer or reverse-proxy server to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
?: (security.W009) Your SECRET_KEY has less than 50 characters, less than 5 unique characters, or it's prefixed with 'django-insecure-' indicating that it was generated automatically by Django. Please generate a long and random value, otherwise many of Django's security-critical features will be vulnerable to attack.
?: (security.W012) SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is not set to True. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.
?: (security.W018) You should not have DEBUG set to True in deployment.
